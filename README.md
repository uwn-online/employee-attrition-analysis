# Employee Attrition Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the key drivers of employee attrition and builds predictive models to identify employees at higher risk of leaving.

## Business Questions
- What factors are most associated with attrition?
- Can we predict attrition risk with acceptable accuracy?
- What actions could reduce attrition (based on insights)?

## Dataset

- Time period:
- Rows / columns:
- Target variable: Attrition (Yes/No)

## Approach
1. Data cleaning & validation
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Modeling (baseline + tuned model)
5. Interpretation (feature importance / explainability)
6. Recommendations
